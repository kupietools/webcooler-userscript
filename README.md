# webcooler-userscript
WebCooler removes hotbutton content from the web to cool it down before it makes you want to do something intemperate.

Basically if there is a person, event, or website whose existence irritates me, this content-filtering user script scrubs them from my internet browsing experience so I never am accidentally reminded of them. You should try it, it's delightful. 

WebCooler goes great with GreaseMonkey, TamperMonkey, or your favorite monkey or non-monkey browser userscript manager.
